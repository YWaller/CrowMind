# Vault Chat - Obsidian Plugin

This plugin utilizes [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) to provide you with a chat bot trained on your vault. You can ask your questions and converse with your vault's chat assistant.

When you first add the Vault Chat plugin, it will need to index your existing vault files for ChatGPT to use during your conversations. This can take time (est. 1 minute per 20 files in your vault). You can use Vault Chat during this time, but until indexing is complete your assistant will not have full context for your conversation.

When you are ready, use the command palette to start your conversation with the command: `Vault Chat: ask ChatGPT`
